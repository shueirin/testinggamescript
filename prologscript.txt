You are the hero of this story.

Your backround is a son/daughter of some ordinary civilian in a village on certain kingdom.

Your daily activity including studying (appereantly this kingdom mandates all their civilian to be able to write and read), working on farm, and combat training (every youth in this village must be trained in combat so they could be used as battle potential in time of need)

Today is your 18th birthday. Your family (father, mother, your 13 years old sister), with several friend from your neighbour (those 3 guys you always hang with ever since you were kid, and the twin sisters from your neighbour that starting to get more pretty) held a small celebration for you. You feel blessed. 

After all the party and stuff, now you're start to wonder what are you going to do with your life. But one thing for sure, as starter your father instructed you to go to the capital to get some experience. 

Several days after the celebration, after preparing the stuff for your journey, it's time for you to leave. You said your farewell to your father, mother, and lastly to your sister (while she keep asking you when will you come back).

You walk out from your house, meet the guys and the twins who were waiting for you outside. Seems they wanted to accompany you until the village gate. They remind you to send them letters and let them know where you will be staying on the capital, so one day if one of them visiting, they can meet you there. The twins are concerned wether will you be seducted by 'some bad girls' in the city (which you deny thir accusation)
