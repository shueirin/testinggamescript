By using the caravan, you're arrived at a certain port city.

You pay the travel fee to the crew of the ship, and got a box of bread and extra food. It's not exquisite service, but enough for one trip. The journey will took 1 and half day.

The ship sails.

You found an empty spot on the ship, and sat there. It's time to do think and plan the course of action when you arrived.

Obviously you will need to find place to settle down (temporarily), at the same time you need to find a some way to make money for your living expenses. Previously you only work on the farm of the lord of the region, and the money were given to your father (thankfully the lord of the land you were lived was a generous man and have good reputation among the peasants). Now you must thinking about how to make your own money, for your own living.

Unfortunately, since you are just new to the world. You absolutely don't know anything. Your father said that is your objective. By getting experience by yourself, you will start gaining knowledge and wisdom. You already have enough skill to protect yourself physically so for a certain time you should be save.
