You are the hero of this story.

Your backround is a son/daughter of some ordinary civilian in a village on certain kingdom.

Your daily activity including studying (appereantly this kingdom mandates all their civilian to be able to write and read), working on farm, and combat training (every youth in this village must be trained in combat so they could be used as battle potential in time of need)

Today is your 18th birthday. Your family (father, mother, your 13 years old sister), with several friend from your neighbour (those 3 guys you always hang with ever since you were kid, and the twin sisters from your neighbour that starting to get more pretty) held a small celebration for you. You feel blessed. 

After all the party and stuff, now you're start to wonder what are you going to do with your life. But one thing for sure is, your father  instructed you to go to the capital to get some experience. It's time for you to live your own live.
